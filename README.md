# sveltekit-firebase-adapter

This is a fork of [simonnepomuk's adapter](https://github.com/simonnepomuk/monorepo#readme) for my own use, but if it's useful for others, feel free to use it.

## Changelog

- Added node 18 & 20 to the `nodeVersion` option.
- Added some extra dependencies that seemed to be missing to the generated `package.json`
- Fixed cors to not be stringified to '{}'
